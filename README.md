Our main analyses can be reproduced using the file `model.R` (the working directory in R should be set to `parental-age/`). Figures will be written to the folder `img/`.

The scripts within `model.R` rely on data in the folder `dat/` (initially produced using `prep-data.R`), functions within `functions.R`, and ggplot themes within `plot-themes.R`.

The scripts are setup to work with the following directory structure:

```
parental-age/ (working directory)
  dat/
  img/
  R/
```
